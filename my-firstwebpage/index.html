    <h1>Don's The Odin Project Journey</h1>
    <p>This is my blog for my journey in TOP and hope in the end I can make a webpage proficiently</p>

    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>The tags that I learned today was strong and em in which they have significally different from b and i</p>

    <h3>Different tags</h3>
    <p>They are the same visually but they have different features which will be important in building a webpage</p>

    <h4>Strong and Bold</h4>
    <p>This <strong>Strong</strong> and this is <b>Bold</b></p>

    <h5>Emphasis and Italized</h5>
    <p>This is <em>Emphasis</em> and this is <i>Italized</i></p>
    <!--This is a breakthrough for me as I always use b and i as I didn't see the point of using strong and em -->
